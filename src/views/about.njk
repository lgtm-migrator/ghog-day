  <p class="h3 not-caps">For centuries, humankind has relied on the prophecies of clairvoyant woodchucks, long may it continue.</p>

  <p class="h3 not-caps">Every February 2nd – in deepest, darkest winter – humanity seeks guidance from groundhog-prophets, whose obscure rituals and ancient tongue foretell of spring’s return.</p>

  <p class="h3 not-caps">GROUNDHOG-DAY.com collects past prognostications and returns them as clean data — either as JSON or in a spreadsheet.</p>

  <p class="h3 not-caps">Only groundhogs know the future, but GROUNDHOG-DAY.com unlocks the past.</p>
