      Thatâ€™s (only) {{ daysLeft }} days from now, so make sure to pick out <a href="/groundhogs">your favourite prognosticator</a> well in advance. Most of them livestream their predictions online, and some of them host a pancake breakfast if you can make it out in person.

    <p>Unfortunately, Groundhog Day is <strong>not</strong> a statutory holiday in <a href="https://canada-holidays.ca" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Canada</a> or the USA.
    
    <h2 class="h5">About Groundhog Day</h2>
